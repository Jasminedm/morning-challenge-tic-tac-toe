This game allows for two players and tracks each players turn. Each square is programmed to show an X or O based on which players turn it is beginning with player 1 as X. Once a winning combination is reached, the winner of the game will be announced and the restart button will allow the users to play again!

While designing this game I learned how to track turns by building  a counter. This was important in order for a game like this to be created!
